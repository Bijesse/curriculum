## Before class

### Objective

Students will understand the basic CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) commands in the terminal. 

### Key points

* A terminal is a way to talk to a computer using commands.
* Commands specify the action you want the computer to do for you.
* Folders can contain folders and/or files. Taken in total, this forms a file hierarchy.

### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../../10-commandline-versioncontrol/lessons/1-commandline/assessments/).
2. Write exit-ticket based off [assessments from current lesson](assessments/).

Students will show progress toward reaching the objective based on their performance on the exit-ticket quiz.

### Vocabulary

* Terminal
* Command
* Path / directory
* Directory structure / hierarchy

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

### Opening

Today we will learn about the command line. This is important because the command line enables us to work in an environment without a visual interface. 

What are files? What are folders? How do I view them in Windows? How about Mac? How do I go about copying a file? How about a folder? When I copy a folder, what happens to everything inside of it? How about if I want to rename a file? And delete a file?

When we perform any of the above operations in Windows or Mac, the operating system is translating our actions into command lines. Let's take a deeper look.

### Introduction of new material ("I do")

#### Terminal

The **terminal** is a place where we talk to a computer. In the terminal, we issue **commands** to the computer. These commands are instructions that we would like the computer to do for us. Typically, if the command was executed successfully, the computer will not respond with anything.

When I open Cloud9 and click on Window->New Terminal, I see something like:

### Guided practice ("We do")



### Independent practice ("You do")



#### Exit ticket

Give exit-ticket quiz.

### Closing

Today you learned about Git. This is important because Git is an essential tool for working on code in a team setting.

#### Homework

[Link to homework](homework/)

Remind students when homework is due and how it will be collected.

## After class

* Grade do-now & exit-ticket. Record in class spreadsheet.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
