Write a function called `countdown()`, that takes a number as its argument. The function should return an array of all of the numbers from this number down to 1.			
			
Example			

```			
countdown(5);		
```

Should return an array like			

```			
[ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]		
```		
			
HINT: Use Array.push() to add items to an array			

Example:		

```			
	var myArray = [];		
	myArray.push(4);		
	myArray.push(3);		
	myArray.push(2);		
	myArray.push(1);		
			
	//Now myArray is [4,3,2,1]		
	```
