# Twitter Bootstrap Project

##Scope

This project involves taking the "About me" created in lesson 2 and adapting it to use Twitter Bootstrap. The objective of this project is to get our students more practice with Bootstrap and also to teach them about the standard layout of a page (header, body, footer, etc).
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have ran through the [Bootstrap lesson](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum/tree/master/units/3-CSS/lessons/4-bootstrap).

### Starter code
*None*

### Solution code


### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../../3-css/lessons/4-bootstrap/assessments/).

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

###Opening

What is Twitter Bootstrap? What does it do? What problem does it solve? 

What is a header? What is a body? What is a footer? Let's open an article on the New York Times: [link](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/dining/the-virtues-of-green-bell-peppers.html?_r=1). Point out where these three sections are on this page.

The people who created Bootstrap knew of these sections. They packed Boostrap with specific styles for these sections and many more.

###Lecture
You are going to take your "About me" page from lesson 2 and adapt it to use Twitter Bootstrap. You are specifically going to make your new page look like [this](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/jumbotron-narrow/). 

###Brianstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. Look at the source code of the link above.
2. Copy it over to your own project.
3. Bring in the Bootstrap CSS file into your project.

###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any quesitons they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)
