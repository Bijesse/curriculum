#Project 8 - Learningpod Test Prep
![Image](http://i.imgur.com/l4fKON1.png)

##Scope
Project: Build a study app for your high school class

For this project students will build their own study app targeting a class that they actually need to study for! The project will test a student’s ability to work with an open API and build something relevant and useful to their own life.

The focus of the project should be building functional code, not design. So, Learningpod will provide a static question and answer design that the students can start with and make interactive using jQuery and Ajax. If there’s time, they can customize this design however they’d like. 

#Before Class
Before class, the teacher should familiarize themselves with the Learningpod API documentation so they can more easily answer student questions as they arise. Learningpod will ensure that, for the purposes of this project, oAuth 2 integration is not required. 

##Vocabulary
* API  
* JSON  
* XML  
* Question  
* Answer  
* Explanation

##Industry Skills
This project improves the student's industry skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**Technical Vocabulary:**  
While completing this project the student will receive aid in the form of technical jargon.

**Paired Programming:**   
While completing this project the student will work in teams to create the project.

**Version Control:**   
While completing this project the student will be using Github to store their programs.

**Code Review:**   
While completing this project the student will look in various libraries and API documentation for reference to the project at hand.

**Debugging**  
This project will require a serious amount of debugging and testing as they will be integrating an external API into a project template that will contain previously written code as well as their own.

##Web Programming Skills
This project improves the student's web programming skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

**API:**   
While completing this project the student will use the Learningpod API to retrieve data.

##Year One Review
This project will improve upon the following skills from the [Year 1 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AobNdyExPHV5dGRWMVI0QVpnSWYtczZZT2ZyV01kcmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they are asked to read the project description and download the template files from GitHub so they can work locally. Following that, they should be directed to the Learninpod [browse page](http://www.learningpod.com/browse) to understand what type of content they will have access to during this project. The should also open and bookmark the [Learningpod API Documentation](http://www.learningpod.com/developer). 

##Opening
The teacher should then explain the project again verbally and emphasize that the focus is on functionally integrating with an API and finding a way to use that within the existing design.

##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these topics.
* Students must have a base knowledge on what an API is
* What is AJAX, how does it work with JSON APIs
* How to fork on GitHub and build off other projects.
* Focus on functionality over design when developing.

##Project Creation Time
During lab time of this project, students should be broken up into groups and be allowed to work together writing code, planning as a group and then writing individually when possible. This will stress their functional teamworking and communication capabilities. Their first step should be to create a theoretical plan. When the group members are confident with the plan they should explain it to the teacher prior to writing any code.

Teachers should be doing three things:  

* Ensure that the students are planning properly.check their verbal/written plan against what’s in the API documentation.
* Assisting groups who need the help, and pointing them in the right direction when necessary.
* Directing Learningpod developers to assist whenever needed.


##Closing
In closing students should quickly demo the functionality of their app, and explain to the group why they chose a particular set of content. They should also share where they got stuck and how they figured out a solution. 

Groups will share their projects with each other in one central location. Students are then encouraged to share this address with teachers and friends since this is a project that many can benefit from.   

##Check for Understanding
Before allowing the students to leave, team members should evaluate their own app and discuss ways in which it could be made better. They should understand how each function is working within their code, and how the data from the API is being parsed and displayed within their own application.

##How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

##Homework

Students should make their applications public and submit the project links to Learningpod by emailing scott@learningpod.com and giving a two paragraph pitch of what their app does and how they built it. These will be featured on the Learningpod company blog.
